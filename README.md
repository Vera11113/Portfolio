# Portfolio
This repository contains my personal projects, including data analysis, automation scripts, web scraping, and machine learning models. The projects vary in complexity, from small pet projects to more comprehensive case studies.

Each project includes:
- A problem statement and solution approach
- Code implementation with explanations
- Data processing and visualization (if applicable)
- Key insights and conclusions

Topics covered:
- Web scraping (e.g., Avito parser and data processing)
- Data analysis and visualization
- Machine learning and NLP
- Backend development

Feel free to explore and reach out if you have any questions! ðŸš€
